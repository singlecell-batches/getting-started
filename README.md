## Downloading folders (aka "cloning repositories")


1. Create a folder called `singlecell-batches`. I keep all my github
   repositories in a folder called `~/code` so mine is located in
   `~/code/singlecell-batches`, so for me, the commands are:
   ```
   cd code
   mkdir singlecell-batches
   ```

## Adding an algorithm

1. Change to your `singelcell-batches` folder. For me, that is in the `~/code`
   folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code/singlecell-batches
    ```
2. Clone the template repository into your algorithm name, e.g. if your
   algorithm is called "combat" you would do:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/singlecell-batches/algorithm-template combat
    ```
3. Add a link to the
